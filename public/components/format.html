          <p class="italic">"Jamming's where the magic happens"</p>
          <p>Jam circles are relaxed, open, inclusive gatherings of musicians and singers who sit in a circle facing each other. Jammers play for enjoyment rather than for audiences, but listeners are welcome.</p>
          <p>A jam is a safe space to learn and grow jamming skills.</p>
          <p>Jams are acoustic. Instruments such as bass and keyboards are exceptions.</p>
          <p>The most important skill that each Jammer brings to a jam is their ability to listen.</p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
            <li><strong>Play</strong> means to play a song.</li>
            <li><strong>Pass</strong> means pass to the next jammer.</li>
            <li><strong>Pick</strong> means pick a song that another jammer plays.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Any Jammer wishing to take a solo should make eye contact with the singer, indicating their willingness to take a solo. They start to solo when the singer gives them ‘the nod’.</p>
          <p>Galway Jam Circle supports jamming for everyone, irrespective of their age, ethnicity, culture, gender identity, religion, language, sexual orientation, ability, disability or social circumstances.</p>
