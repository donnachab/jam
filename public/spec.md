# High-Level Feature Specification & Analysis

This document serves as the master checklist for the website's functionality. It has been updated to reflect the completed refactoring work.

## 1. General / Site-wide

### 1.1. Functional Requirements

* **Layout & Navigation:**
    * `[✅]` The header element is sticky.
    * `[✅]` The mobile menu is implemented for smaller screens.
    * `[✅]` All navigation links scroll smoothly and close the mobile menu.
* **Asset Loading:**
    * `[✅]` All external libraries and fonts are loaded correctly.
    * `[✅]` The application is initiated by a single ES6 module ([`js/main.js`](./js/main.js)).
    * `[✅]` The site is broken down into small HTML components, loaded on demand by the `loadComponent` function to improve initial page load speed.

## 2. Admin Mode & Authentication

### 2.1. Functional Requirements

* **State Management:**
    * `[✅]` Admin status is managed using `sessionStorage`.
    * `[✅]` The site automatically initializes in Admin Mode if a session is active.
* **Authentication Flow:**
    * `[✅]` The "Admin" button in the footer triggers a PIN prompt modal.
    * `[✅]` The PIN is sent securely in the body of an **`HTTP POST` request**, fixing the original security flaw.
* **UI State:**
    * `[✅]` Admin Mode correctly shows/hides all `.admin-controls`.
    * `[✅]` The "Admin" button text toggles correctly.

### 2.2. Remaining Tasks

> 🧐 **UX Flaw:** The `modal.js` file does not yet show a "Verifying..." loading state while the PIN is being checked.
>
> **To Do:** Modify the `showModal` function in [`js/ui/modal.js`](./js/ui/modal.js) to handle a "loading" type, and update [`js/admin/admin-mode.js`](./js/admin/admin-mode.js) to use it.

## 3. Hero Section (`#home`)

### 3.1. Functional Requirements

    * `[✅]` The "Change Cover Photo" button and form are functional.
    * `[✅]` The user receives success/error feedback via a modal after submission.

### 3.2. Remaining Tasks

> 🧐 **Robustness Flaw:** The form does not yet validate that the input is a valid URL format before saving.

### 4.1. Functional Requirements

    * `[✅]` The list is sorted chronologically.
    * `[✅]` The data model now stores the full, unambiguous date (`YYYY-MM-DD`) in Firestore, fixing the critical design flaw of the original site.
* **Admin - Jam Management:**
    * `[✅]` Admin controls ("Edit", "Cancel"/"Reinstate", "Delete") appear for each confirmed jam.
    * `[✅]` A "Confirm" button appears for placeholder jams, opening the form pre-filled with the correct date, which improves the admin workflow.

> **To Do:** Add client-side validation in [`js/community.js`](./js/community.js) to make the relevant fields required based on the selected item type.
